<h2><a id="Service_design_1"></a>Service design</h2>
<p>
The service is composed by 4 parts, or modules, that interact with each other.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>neo4jAPI</b> module offers all the functionalities (methods) needed in order to 
	access the Neo4J Service (deploy/undeploy/update nodes, properties, labels..).</li>

	<li>The <b>nfvSystem</b> module is the central part of the service and it keeps 
	an updated database with all the objects currently existing in the NFV system 
	and also their correspondence with the nodes and relations deployed on the Neo4J 
	Web Service. This package implements all the interfaces needed for accessing 
	data in the NFV System, and it provides the necessary middle layer to add Nodes, 
	NFFGs or Links and also to remove them from the system.
	<br>
	When any deployable object is added to the system it is also deployed into the 
	Neo4J service and when it’s removed it is also undeployed from the Neo4J Service.
    <br>
    The database 
	<ul>
	    <li> keeps <b>objects ordered according to their name</b>, this is useful when 
		paginating, we have O(log(n)) time when adding a new object but ordering is not 
		necessary when returning a specific page.</li>
		<li> and manages <b>concurrent access to data</b> avoiding any situation that 
		may result in an inconsistent state of the data in the nfvSystem.</li>
	</ul>
	The main access point of this module is the <em>NfvSystem</em> and the parts that compose this module are:
	<ul>
	   <li>the <em>NfvSystemDBMS</em> which implements the database functionalities as 
	   described above</li>
	   
	   <li>the <em>NfvSystemLoader</em> which loads NFV data from the random generator 
	   at startup</li>
	   
	   <li>the <em>NfvSystemDeplyer</em> which interacts with the neo4jAPI module in order
	   to deploy/undeploy complex objects such as whole NFFGs, Nodes, and Hosts</li>
	   
	   <li>the <em>NfvSystemIDService</em> which is a database used to keep track of the
	   correspondence between objects in the NFV System and objects deployed in the Neo4J 
	   Service (it manages concurrent access but no sorting is required in this case)</li>
	   
	   <li>the implementation of the NFV interfaces</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li> The <b>reachability</b> package provides access to the advanced functions of 
	the Neo4J Service (by using the neo4jAPI functionalities) and implements the 
	necessary interfaces for getting the extended information about nodes.
	<br>
	Since the operations provided are quite expensive in terms of computational time this
	module use <b>asynchronous requests</b> to retrieve data from the Neo4J Service.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>resources</b> package manages requests from clients and forwards them
	to the nfvSystem. Since the number of objects in the system may be very large, 
	it provides, when deemed useful, and according to the REST API documentation, 
	options to paginate responses or to return less-detailed objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Service implements a <b>HATEOAS</b> functionality, yet it is not fully complete 
and the client may have to add optional queries to URIs by himself.</p>
<p>
Since the number of objects in the system may be very large and in order to allow 
clients to choose how much data to exchange with the service, the system provides, 
when deemed useful options 
<ul>
	<li> to return data about Nodes, Hosts and NFFGs with <b>different levels of details</b>, 
	for example when requesting data about an NFFG the client may choose to receive or not 
	also detailed info about nodes belonging to that NFFG.</li>
	<li> to request <b>pagination</b> of responses: the client may choose which 
	page and how many items per page to receive.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Deploying_an_NFFG_17"></a>Deploying an NFFG</h2>
<p>
The service offers the possibility to deploy a complete NFFG, with nodes and links, 
in a single request. 
When an NFFG is deployed all its Nodes and Links are added to the system, 
corresponding and necessary GraphNodes and Relationships are created into the 
Neo4J Service and if adding the complete NFFG fails, then loaded data is 
removed from the system and undeployed from the Neo4J Service.</p>
<p>
An NFFG may also be deployed without nodes or link, or only with nodes.</p>
<p>
When adding nodes (within an NFFG or independently) the client may suggest the 
hosting host. If this one has not enough memory or storage available or no VNFs 
slots then another one may be chosen randomly.</p>

<h2><a id="The_position_of_Links_25"></a>The position of Links</h2>
<p>
Since the Links have meaning only within an HFFG, there is not a global collection 
resource with Links, but they may be accessed from NFFGs or from Nodes always relatively 
to the “current” NFFG or Node.</p>
